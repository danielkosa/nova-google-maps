# Laravel Nova Google Maps Field

A laravel nova field to easily enter an address (uses the Algolia Places API) and show a preview in a Google Map. The result is stored in a json column and contains all the data sent by Algolia.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require whitecube/nova-google-maps
```

## Usage

``` php
use Whitecube\NovaGoogleMaps\GoogleMaps;

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        // ...

        GoogleMaps::make('Map')
            ->zoom(8) // Optionally set the zoom level
            ->defaultCoordinates($lat, $lng) // Optionally set the map's default center point
    ];
}
```

## Storage
The field stores the JSON data sent back by Algolia (minus a few unneeded sub-objects). This gives you a lot of information on the selected place/address. Here is an example:

```json
{
    "name": "Bruxelles", 
    "type": "city", 
    "query": "Bruxelles", 
    "value": "Bruxelles, R√©gion de Bruxelles-Capitale - Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest, Belgique", 
    "county": "Bruxelles-Capitale", 
    "latlng": {"lat": 50.8466, "lng": 4.3517}, 
    "country": "Belgique", 
    "postcode": "1000", 
    "countryCode": "be", 
    "administrative": "R√©gion de Bruxelles-Capitale - Brussels Hoofdstedelijk Gewest"
}
```

## Configuration
By default, you should reference your Google Maps API key in your `.env` file:

```
NOVA_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Optionally, you can publish the config to change the API key location and the map's language by doing: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nova-google-maps`.
