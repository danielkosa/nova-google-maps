# Laravel Nova Google Maps Field

A laravel nova field to easily enter an address (uses the Algolia Places API) and show a preview in a Google Map. The result is stored in a json column and contains all the data sent by Algolia.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require whitecube/nova-google-maps
```

## Usage

``` php
use Whitecube\NovaGoogleMaps\GoogleMaps;

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
 * @return array
 */
public function fields(Request $request)
{
    return [
        // ...

        GoogleMaps::make('Map')
            ->zoom(8) // Optionally set the zoom level
            ->defaultCoordinates($lat, $lng) // Optionally set the map's default center point
    ];
}
```

## Configuration
By default, you should reference your Google Maps API key in your `.env` file:

```
NOVA_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Optionally, you can publish the config to change the API key location and the map's language by doing: `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=nova-google-maps`.
